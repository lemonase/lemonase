Here is your daily fortune from "bunny".

/ Many enraged psychiatrists are inciting \
| a weary butcher. The butcher is weary   |
| and tired because he has cut meat and   |
| steak and lamb for hours and weeks. He  |
| does not desire to chant about anything |
| with raving psychiatrists, but he sings |
| about his gingivectomist, he dreams     |
| about a single cosmologist, he thinks   |
| about his dog. The dog is named         |
| Herbert.                                |
|                                         |
