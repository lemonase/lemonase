/ Mind! I don't mean to say that I know,  \
| of my own knowledge, what there is      |
| particularly dead about a door-nail. I  |
| might have been inclined, myself, to    |
| regard a coffin-nail as the deadest     |
| piece of ironmongery in the trade. But  |
| the wisdom of our ancestors is in the   |
| simile; and my unhallowed hands shall   |
| not disturb it, or the Country's done   |
| for. You will therefore permit me to    |
| repeat, emphatically, that Marley was   |
| as dead as a door-nail.                 |
|                                         |
