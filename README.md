/ At once it struck me what quality went \
| to form a man of achievement,          |
| especially in literature, and which    |
| Shakespeare possessed so enormously -- |
| I mean negative capability, that is,   |
| when a man is capable of being in      |
| uncertainties, mysteries, doubts,      |
| without any irritable reaching after   |
| fact and reason.                       |
|                                        |
\ -- John Keats                          /
