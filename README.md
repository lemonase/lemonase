/ It is right that he too should have his \
| little chronicle, his memories, his     |
| reason, and be able to recognize the    |
| good in the bad, the bad in the worst,  |
| and so grow gently old all down the     |
| unchanging days and die one day like    |
| any other day, only shorter.            |
|                                         |
