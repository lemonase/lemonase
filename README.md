## Hey GitHubz 🌍👋

I'm just a guy who enjoys using, creating and contributing to Free and Open Source Software whenever possible (for practical and philosophical purposes).

I can all but guarantee that I'm not the best developer out there, but I'm always learning and looking for ways to contribute and expand my skills wherever there is a need.

Right now my go to programming languages are: Python, JavaScript and Go. I'm a fan of shell/batch scripting for doing quick and dirty tasks as well.
