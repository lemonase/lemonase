/ Even the clearest and most perfect      \
| circumstantial evidence is likely to be |
| at fault, after all, and therefore      |
| ought to be received with great         |
| caution. Take the case of any pencil,   |
| sharpened by any woman; if you have     |
| witnesses, you will find she did it     |
| with a knife; but if you take simply    |
| the aspect of the pencil, you will say  |
| that she did it with her teeth.         |
|                                         |
