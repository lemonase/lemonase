### Hey Internetz 👋🌐 

I'm just a guy who enjoys using Open Source and Free Software for both practical and philosophical reasons.
I'm not the best programmer out there, but I'm always learning and looking for ways to test and expand my skills.
Right now my go to languages are Python, JavaScript and Go.
