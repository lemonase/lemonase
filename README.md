/ The true Southern watermelon is a boon \
| apart, and not to be mentioned with    |
| commoner things. It is chief of the    |
| world's luxuries, king by the grace of |
| God over all the fruits of the earth.  |
| When one has tasted it, he knows what  |
| the angels eat. It was not a Southern  |
| watermelon that Eve took; we know it   |
| because she repented.                  |
|                                        |
